# Water Potability Classification

###### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability)

#### Summary

Implementation of predictive models to determine if the sample tested from a body of water is fit for human consumption. This project includes exploratory analysis, data cleaning, preprocessing, and execution of KNN and Random Forest models for comparison.

*	Explore data using label counts, box plots, correlation matrices and density plots
*	Remove outliers using interquartile range and observe variable skew
*	Partition data then normalize the train and test sets independently
*	Implement KNN and RF Models, observe accuracy and feature importance for each model
*	Markdown with explanation of insights and ways to improve accuracy and specificity
